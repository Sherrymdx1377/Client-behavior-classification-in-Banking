# Client-behavior-classification-in-Banking

The purpose of this project is to master classification clients in banking for machine learning models.
During the work, the task of a preliminary analysis of a positive response (term deposit) to direct calls from the bank is solved. In essence, the task is the matter of bank scoring, i.e. according to the characteristics of clients (potential clients), their behavior is predicted (loan default, a wish to open a deposit, etc.).

By completing this project, the following questions are answered:

1.What are the most useful Python libraries for classification analysis?

2. How to transform category data?

3. How to create DataSet?

4. How to do features selection?
   
5. How to make, fit and visualize classification model?
